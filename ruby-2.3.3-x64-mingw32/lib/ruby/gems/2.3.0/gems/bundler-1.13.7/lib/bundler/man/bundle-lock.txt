1mUPDATING ALL GEMS0m
       If you run 1mbundle lock 22mwith  1m--update  22moption	without  list  of  gems,
       bundler	will  ignore  any  previously  installed  gems and resolve all
       dependencies again based on the latest versions of all  gems  available
       in the sources.

1mUPDATING A LIST OF GEMS0m
       Sometimes, you want to update a single gem in the Gemfile(5), and leave
       the rest of the gems that you specified locked to the versions  in  the
       1mGemfile.lock22m.

       For  instance,  you  only  want	to  update  1mnokogiri22m,  run 1mbundle lock0m
       1m--update nokogiri22m.

       Bundler will update 1mnokogiri 22mand any of its dependencies, but leave the
       rest  of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the 1mGem-0m
       1mfile.lock22m.
